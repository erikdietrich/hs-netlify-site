- As a former techie that misses the craft at times, I try to make a passing effort to keep up.  Kubernetes and Terraform are techs that postdate my involvement, but I found [this tutorial](https://www.architect.io/blog/2021-02-17/terraform-kubernetes-tutorial) to be interesting nonetheless.
- One of the hardest things in the QA world is testing your systems when they interact with and customize major pieces of commercial software.  That makes offerings, like this one for [SAP end to end testing](https://www.tricentis.com/sap/end-to-end-testing), invaluable for businesses with complex software ecosystems.
- If you're doing any web scraping or applications resulting in being throttled, Proxyrack will soon have [ISP proxies](https://proxyrack.com/isp-proxies) available for you.
