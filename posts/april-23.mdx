## Terraform ECS
While my app dev days are a little far in my rearview, I do like to try to keep up here and there with what’s going on, to be at least passingly informed.  So I found it interesting to read [this tutorial about managing an AWS ECS cluster with Terraform](https://www.architect.io/blog/2021-03-30/create-and-manage-an-aws-ecs-cluster-with-terraform/).

## ITIL Release Management

Back in my management consulting days, I spent a lot of time in the enterprise, where getting things to production more quickly was a serious struggle.  I can therefore appreciate a piece of content that [walks through ITIL release management](https://www.enov8.com/blog/what-is-release-management-in-itil-guide-and-best-practices/) in an approachable way.

## Svelte vs React

File another one here under “finger on the pulse” category for me.  I have no idea what I’d choose for a front end tech these days (though I have been writing a little javascript to support our keyword research checks and modeling), but I’m glad to know that content like [this comparison of svelte and react](https://requestmetrics.com/blog/community/svelte-vs-react-on-performance/) exists, to help me out.

## Exploratory Testing

When I used to do a lot of work with software quality consulting, I remember one of the most important lessons for organizations being to automate as much of the test pyramid as maintainably possible for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is eliminating toil among the QA folks.  This frees them up to do [exploratory testing](https://www.tricentis.com/learn/exploratory-testing), which I think is an underappreciated concept.

## Slack-JIRA Integration

I feel like I’m in a constant battle to keep the amount of systems are distributed business uses to a minimum.  Slack, Asana, Trello, ClickUp, Google Office, Hubspot, etc.  Nothing against any of these tools, but they tend to proliferate when you’re not careful to stop it.  I can’t always prevent that, but at least I can help them play more nicely together through integrations, like the one described in [this guide to integrating JIRA and Slack](https://www.wrangle.io/post/slack-integrations-with-jira-uses-and-how-to-set-it-up).
